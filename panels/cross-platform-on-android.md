There won't be a solution for all platforms as long it is not on the same platform.

New tools have new pain points.

Don't try to convince, but provide information.

Hard to build libraries for several platforms. 

## Process for multi platform
Depends on the team. API team can help to reduce the burden on the different mobile teams.

Developers should know one platform very good, but be able to talk to others.

User stories needed to be more precise if talking to two or more teams. So, cross-platform helps here.

One platform should lead in order to have many iterations of the app fast.

Uber Ribs? Great! Think about sharing architecture first, then code. There are so many platforms, maybe a new client for a different platform is needed.

Kotlin cross-platform is still early stage. The goal should be to create a business logic architecture and then UI.

Kotlin to web assembly, new web API standard bring new aspects to the cross platform.

Platforms are getting closer together, so it becomes easier to develop for all of them maybe even new ones.
