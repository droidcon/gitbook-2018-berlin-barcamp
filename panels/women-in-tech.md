# Women in Tech (Working Title)

Topics
* Diversity in Tech and why it is important
* Experiences, benefits, and challenges of women in tech
* Why you should hire moms & how to hire moms

The lack of diversity, or non-defaults, in the business of making technology is a
problem in both the startup world and the established tech industry. We are very
excited to have successful women in the technology industry from different fields that
can share their knowledge and experiences regarding this topic. Key questions will
include: What the current barriers facing women in the technology industry are; why
diversity in the tech industry is so important, why you should hire moms, and why
role models are important to inspire girls to enter the world of technology. We are
going to be exploring these through the perspectives of both, the employer and
employee.
