## Navigation in Clean Architecture

Dima

We will try to expose Uncle Bob's approach to Viper by providing Router to it. 
With it help we will solve problems for a complicated navigation, pass data between screens elegantly
and most importantly handle fragments which could be not so bad :)
This approach will be compared with the newly introduced solution from Google during I/O 2018.
