Droidcon Global Community Platform Discussion

DroidconHQ is developing a global community platform to connect our worldwide droidcon attendees.
The community platform will allow you to connect with other developers globally, get the latest news and insights,
discuss (forums), get connected with cool jobs, etc.

We would like to discuss with our Berlin community about which features are important.  What will make this platform great?
What concerns do you have?  How are we addressing privacy, etc?

Join us for a discussion and be part of shaping your digital droidcon home.
