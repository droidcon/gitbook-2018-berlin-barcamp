# Androids Play Mario Kart Together

Bring your Nintendo Switch + Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to Berlin!

We are a global group of Android developers who play Mario Kart online on weekly basis.

We would like to invite all Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players to join us for training and a tournament session during Droidcon's Interactive Day! And because we're at a conference, there'll be at least one slide to be looked at, too.

_More details will come soon, but don't forget to pack your console :D_

In the meantime we'd like to encourage you to join our weekly online race:

It comprises 8 races @ 150cc and after 4 races the groups get reshuffled. Here's the \#AndroidPeepsWeekly tournament code: 0419-7590-5835.

Weekly racing times are currently \(times listed are for countries with active players\):

New Zealand: Sunday 8:30am

Australia \(Sydney\): Sunday 6:30am

Germany: Saturday 10:30pm

United Kingdom: Saturday 9:30pm
