# Androids Play Mario Kart Together

Bring your Nintendo Switch + Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to Berlin!

We are a global group of Android developers who play Mario Kart online on weekly basis.

We would like to invite all Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players to join us for training and a tournament session during Droidcon's Interactive Day! And because we're at a conference, there'll be at least one slide to be looked at, too.

*More details will come soon, but don't forget to pack your console :D*
